            <p>We’ve worked with nutritionists to make sure that the food parcels supplied by food banks in our network contain at least three days worth of nutritionally balanced meals for individuals and families. These emergency food parcels are not designed to meet long-term need  that’s why food banks also offer additional support like debt advice where possible.</p>
